Step 2: File Upload to S3 via API Gateway and Lambda

2.1 Setting Up the API Gateway
Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon API Gateway service.
Create a New API:
Choose 'REST API' and select 'Build'.
Choose 'New API', give it a name, and a description.
Select 'Edge Optimized' (default) and click 'Create API'.

2.3 Integrating Lambda with API Gateway
Go back to your API Gateway and create a new resource and method:

 

Create a new resource under your API.
Add a POST method to this resource.
Connect this method to the Lambda function you just created.
Deploy the API:

 

Create a new stage (e.g., 'prod') and deploy your API to this stage.
Note the Invoke URL generated by API Gateway.

2.4 Updating the Frontend
Update Your HTML/JavaScript:
Add JavaScript code to your webpage to handle file uploads. This code should:
Make an AJAX call to the API Gateway endpoint to get the presigned URL.
Upload the file to the S3 bucket using the presigned URL.
